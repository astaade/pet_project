Number Guessing Game - Pet Coding Project
Introduction
The Pet Coding Project presents a simple number guessing game designed to reinforce basic programming skills while incorporating modern programming best practices. This project aims to restore and enhance proficiency in fundamental language concepts such as variables, data types, conditional logic, loops, functions, and classes. By implementing a straightforward game function, the researcher can focus on the right technology without getting overwhelmed by complexity. The game is coded in Python, taking advantage of its simple syntax and extensive libraries.

Game Overview
The number guessing game generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using Python's built-in random module. Players attempt to guess the generated number, and validation ensures that only valid integers are accepted. The game allows multiple guesses within loops, and functions divide the execution into logical parts, such as initializing the game, asking for inputs, checking assumptions, and computing results.

Technologies and Best Practices
A. Use and understand Git
Version control with Git is employed for tracking changes, collaboration, and bug reporting. The repository is hosted on GitHub, featuring branches like main for production-ready code, develop as the main working branch, and feature/game-logic for implementing core game functionality.

B. UML Diagrams
Visual representation of the project includes three UML diagrams:

Activity Diagram: Models the flow of actions in the game.
Class Diagram: Illustrates key classes and their relationships.
Deployment Diagram: Depicts hardware and connections.
C. Requirements Mapping
User stories are mapped using Trello and Jira boards, documenting approximately 5-10 user stories around major functionalities like random number generation, user input, guess checking, and score tracking.

D. Domain Driven Design
Expanded features include multiplayer mode, platform high score tracking, power-ups, multiple difficulty settings, and visual representations. Domain mapping diagrams highlight relationships between domains and potential areas for decomposition.

E. Metrics
SonarCloud integration provides detailed quality metrics, including unit test coverage, code duplication, technical debt, coding standards, and potential bugs.

F. Clean Code Development
Clean coding practices, such as descriptive variable/function names, modularization, formatting standards, meaningful comments, and error handling, are incorporated.

G. Build Management
Travis CI is set up for automated build processes, including installing dependencies, running unit tests, building documentation, and deploying to a staging server.

H. Testing
Automated testing and continuous integration ensure code quality and catch potential regressions.

I. IDE Proficiency and Debugging
IDE skills include Git integration, an interactive Python console, a unit test runner, and documentation support. Shortcuts like double shift, ctrl + /, shift + f6, and alt + enter are used for efficiency.

Conclusion
This pet project provides hands-on experience in various aspects of the software development lifecycle, from analysis and design to version control and automated testing. The combination of coding basics and modern best practices equips the researcher with valuable skills applicable to more complex projects in the future. The ability to conceptualize, design, and implement a simple game lays the foundation for building reliable enterprise-level applications.
