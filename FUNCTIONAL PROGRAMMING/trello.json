Depending on your business, you may choose to roll the Sales Strategy into the Marketing Strategy section.\n\n","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"somruproy+31tt5s9e6zavd5rj3s6+31tthr0p9y88njsdg9w+0250m1y5mp@boards.trello.com","idBoard":"65acfb348d77a250890dcaf2","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":["65acfb348d77a250890dcc00"],"idList":"65acfb348d77a250890dcaf8","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"65acebbff1f784cc5b5cfa17","idShort":22,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[{"id":"65acfb348d77a250890dcc00","idBoard":"65acfb348d77a250890dcaf2","name":"","color":"blue","uses":10}],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":true,"name":"Introduction","nodeId":"ari:cloud:trello::card/workspace/65acebbff1f784cc5b5cfa17/65acfb348d77a250890dcba4","pos":65535,"shortLink":"hSXYuEfp","shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/hSXYuEfp","staticMapUrl":null,"start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/hSXYuEfp/22-introduction","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db6","size":"normal","brightness":"light","scaled":[{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dc0","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dc0","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/140x93/11cec5f07f2346a3007d4acdb62e2eb6/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":6527,"height":93,"width":140},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbf","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbf","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/256x170/cfb21d43334883b987ef93071a2f75d7/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":16479,"height":170,"width":256},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbe","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbe","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/480x319/29f35707f14a7191f7db3a177c3a2c47/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":46359,"height":319,"width":480},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbd","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbd","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/960x638/eacd3abfd4c6b4db91dd654097f4aae8/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":148333,"height":638,"width":960},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbc","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbc","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1024x680/47cf46d10da991b4a61284c1a78f0913/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":164895,"height":680,"width":1024},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dba","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dba","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1280x850/094c0ac4072705d6c2e526285dd17ac5/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":240347,"height":850,"width":1280},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db9","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db9","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1920x1275/9556e6acc46722496799957da361ac36/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":474162,"height":1275,"width":1920},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbb","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9dbb","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/2048x1360/a1ec182e47925118441ee410a615ef5d/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":522975,"height":1360,"width":2048},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db8","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db8","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/2409x1600/948cc990d471b9a3eaf99213a111f107/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f.jpg","bytes":682326,"height":1600,"width":2409},{"_id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db7","id":"5c0662b0057ed5504dbd9db7","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/2560x1700/79854a0c95263f397879883a22eb555e/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f","bytes":5477299,"height":1700,"width":2560}],"edgeColor":"#d9a281","sharedSourceUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1434626881859-194d67b2b86f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjcwNjZ9&w=2560&h=2048&q=90","idPlugin":null},"isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"65acfb348d77a250890dcba6","address":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"checkItemStates":[],"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dueComplete":false,"dateLastActivity":"2024-01-21T11:08:37.059Z","desc":"In this section, summarize the industry in which you will compete.

This can be a good place to paint a brief and attractive picture of how a hypothetical customer will interact with your business.  This is especially effective for service businesses.\n\nThe Operations section outlines how you will run your business and deliver value to your customers.  Operations is defined as the processes used to deliver your products and services to the marketplace and can include manufacturing, transportation, logistics, travel, printing, consulting, after-sales service, and so on.  In all likelihood, about 80% of your expenses will be for operations,  80% of your employees will be working in operations, and 80% of your time will be spent worrying about operating problems and opportunities.  Be sure that you carefully link the design of your operations to your marketing plan.  For example, if high quality will be one of your comparative advantages in the marketplace, then design your operations to deliver high quality, not low costs.  Remember that you will probably have to make trade-offs with your operations.  It is impossible to have the lowest costs, highest quality, best on-time performance, and most flexibility in your industry all at the same time.  Often, higher quality means higher costs, lower costs means less variety and less flexibility.  Be careful how you make these trade-offs so that you can deliver products to the market in accordance with your marketing plan!","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"somruproy+31tt5s9e6zavd5rj3s6+31tthr0p9y88njsdgaj+06i3cukkge@boards.trello.com","idBoard":"65acfb348d77a250890dcaf2","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":["65acfb348d77a250890dcc00"],"idList":"65acfb348d77a250890dcafa","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"65acebbff1f784cc5b5cfa17","idShort":35,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[{"id":"65acfb348d77a250890dcc00","idBoard":"65acfb348d77a250890dcaf2","name":"","color":"blue","uses":10}],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":true,"name":"Introduction","nodeId":"ari:cloud:trello::card/workspace/65acebbff1f784cc5b5cfa17/65acfb348d77a250890dcbbb","pos":65535,"shortLink":"jEgx84oP","shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/jEgx84oP","staticMapUrl":null,"start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/jEgx84oP/35-introduction","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec74","size":"normal","brightness":"light","scaled":[{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec75","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec75","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/140x93/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":4819,"height":93,"width":140},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec76","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec76","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/256x171/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":14088,"height":171,"width":256},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec77","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec77","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/480x320/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":42148,"height":320,"width":480},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec78","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec78","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/960x640/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":142132,"height":640,"width":960},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec79","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec79","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1024x683/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":160572,"height":683,"width":1024},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7b","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7b","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1280x854/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":241771,"height":854,"width":1280},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7c","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7c","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/1920x1280/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":504268,"height":1280,"width":1920},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7a","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7a","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/2048x1366/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":564463,"height":1366,"width":2048},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7d","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7d","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/2400x1600/783a84b398fe1740a8aada9eb0bb0616/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2.jpg","bytes":739455,"height":1600,"width":2400},{"_id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7e","id":"5e61e55d8a0a8d38f995ec7e","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello-backgrounds.s3.amazonaws.com/SharedBackground/original/9e68ed45d74b3c382e0c9df861c6a537/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2","bytes":1198458,"height":1707,"width":2560}],"edgeColor":"#8f8a93","sharedSourceUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583083112996-ff4806d206e2?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjcwNjZ9&w=2560&h=2048&q=90","idPlugin":null},"isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"attachments":[],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"65acfb348d77a250890dcbbd","address":null,"badges":{"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"attachments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"start":null},"checkItemStates":[],"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"dueComplete":false,"dateLastActivity":"2024-01-21T11:08:37.318Z","desc":"In this subsection, describe how you will fulfill your marketing strategy using operations: How will we use operations to add value for customers in our target market?

If you are starting a business, what are all of the steps that you need to accomplish to get the business up and running?  If you are expanding a business, what do you need to do to make it grow?  These steps can be as routine as securing retail space, or as critical as applying for and getting a patent on key technology.  Don't go into too much detail here.

Many venture capitalist claim they will invest in a strong management team with a mediocre idea, but will decline to fund a weak management team with a great idea.  The purpose of the Management section therefore is to convince the reader that you have a great management team to complement a great business concept. This is not the place for modesty or self-depreciation.  Be honest, but highlight your accomplishments and your capabilities while mitigating any obvious shortcomings or weaknesses.  For example, if you are young and inexperienced, accentuate your energy, capacity for hard work, and willingness to learn, while downplaying your lack of experience.

You've outlined a great business concept, demonstrated a real need in the marketplace, shown how you will execute your ideas, proven that your team is just right to manage the venture, and now you will show how much money everyone is going to make.  Note, however, that if your business concept is weak, or there is not a market, or if your execution is poor, or if your management team is incompetent, then your financial plans are doomed to failure.  If you haven't convinced your readers by no win the strength of your concept, then they won't be convinced with your financials. \nHaving said this, it is important that you have strong, well constructed financials.  If you can't show that your great concept is going to make (lots of) money, your readers will quickly lose interest.  To construct your financials, we highly recommend that you start with your development and operations plan to create a schedule or timetable of development and operational activities.  From these development activities, you can then create cash-flow projections, income statements, and pro forma balance sheets for at least three years into the future, and sometimes five.   As a rule of thumb, your financial projections should extend far enough into the future to the point where your business has achieved stable operations.  The first year of your financial statement projections should be month-by-month since cash flows are critical in the early stages of any startup.  Second and third year financial statements should be quarterly, and fourth and fifth years should be annual. If possible, it is useful to include best case, expected case, and worse case scenarios with your financials.  This allows you and your readers to explore the upside potential and downside risks of your venture.  Be sure that your financial projections are in congruence with the other sections of your plan.  For example, if you say you will open 3 stores in Year 2 and your financials showing you opening 5 stores, readers will quickly lose confidence in your plan.  \nThe Summary of Financials section should be a discussion and description of your financial projections -- put the actual financial spreadsheets in the Appendices.  Describe the timing and amount of investment that you will require to achieve your plans.

If you have decided to seek equity capital, then you need to offer a potential investor (F&F, VC, angel, alliance partner) a specified piece of your company in return for a specific amount of money .  If you are seeking a loan, then you need to request a potential lender (F&F, bank, customer) for a specific amount of money in return for a specific return.  In either case, it is important that you be specific with your funding needs, that you clearly spell out and sell the advantages of your proposal to the investor, and make it clear how investors can eventually get their money back out of your venture.  Also, it is important that you persuade investors that the deal you are offering is fair to them and is supported by the facts.  Finally, remember that everything is open to negotiation, so don't give away the farm on the first round!
