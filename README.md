**About Project**
>> Number Guessing Game - Pet Coding Project Introduction

   The Pet Coding Project presents a simple number guessing game designed to reinforce basic programming skills while incorporating modern programming best 
   practices. This project aims to restore and enhance proficiency in fundamental language concepts such as variables, data types, conditional logic, loops, 
   functions, and classes. By implementing a straightforward game function, the researcher can focus on the right technology without getting overwhelmed by 
   complexity. The game is coded in Python, taking advantage of its simple syntax and extensive libraries.

>> Game Overview

The number guessing game generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using Python's built-in random module. Players attempt to guess the generated number, and validation ensures that only valid integers are accepted. The game allows multiple guesses within loops, and functions divide the execution into logical parts, such as initializing the game, asking for inputs, checking assumptions, and computing results.
