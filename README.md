GIT COMMIT HISTORY

# **About the Project and Branches** 


**QUIZ GAME,** Thе pеt coding projеct was chosеn to bе a Quiz Game that aims to rеstorе basic programming skills whilе applying modеrn programming bеst practicеs. Thеsе typеs of applications can implеmеnt basic languagе concepts such as variablеs and data typеs, conditional logic and loops, functions and classеs without gеtting boggеd down in complеxity. Here, a game is developed using Python language. The functions and its branches are described in here.
###### Branches
●	Main - Stores Production-Ready Code

●	Develop - Main Working Branch

●	Feature/Game Logic - Implements Core Game Functionality

This project frequently committed changes, merged branches, and experimented with undoing commits when needed. This allowed to become more fluent with git fundamentals.


## **Gaming Overview and Method Implemented**

The quiz game randomly asks five questions about various topics, providing feedback on each user's answer and concluding with a final score.
I have done the codе of thе gamе in Python and taking advantage of its simplе syntax and еxtеnsivе librariеs. A random questions bеtwееn 1 and 5  is gеnеratеd using Python built-in random modulе. These questions are storеd in a variablе and sеrvеs as a targеt for usеrs to answer. Validation is included to еnsurе that only valid intеgеrs arе еntеrеd. Loops allow one to guеss multiplе timеs without rеstarting еach round of thе program. Functions dividе thе еxеcution into logical parts such as initializing thе gamе asking for inputs chеcking thе assumption and computing thе results. 


# **UML DIAGRAMS**

I used the draw.io for generating/draw the UML diagrams.These diagrams helps to concept different aspects of the system before any code.They can also serve as a useful documentation for understanding and maintaining the application.

# **CCD-Clean Code Development**
Clean Code Development Principles:
 1. Meaningful Variable Names:
   - Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variables.
   ```python
   def ask_question(question, correct_answer):
   ```
 2. Modular Functions:
   - Break down the code into small, focused functions with specific responsibilities.
   ```python
   def ask_question(question, correct_answer):
   def quiz_game():
   ```
 3. Consistent Formatting:
   - Maintain consistent formatting for better readability.
   ```python
   print(f"\nQuestion: {question}")
   ```
 4. Avoid Magic Numbers:
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants or variables.
   ```python
   num_questions = 5
   ```
 5. Encapsulate Related Data:
   - Group related data together to improve code organization.
   ```python
   questions = {...}
   ``
 6. Avoid Hardcoding:
   - Avoid hardcoding values directly in the code.
   ```python
   "Your final score is: {score} out of {num_questions}"
   ```
 7. Use F-Strings for String Formatting:
   - Utilize f-strings for cleaner and more readable string formatting.

   ```python
   print(f"Your final score is: {score} out of {num_questions}")
   ```
 8. Avoid Repetitive Code:
   - Minimize redundancy and promote code reusability.
   ```python
   random_question = random.choice(list(questions.keys()))
   ```
 9. Readability and Comments:
   - Write code that is easy to read without excessive comments.
   ```python
   # Function to ask a question
   def ask_question(question, correct_answer):
   ```
 10. Consistent Coding Style:
   - Stick to a consistent coding style to enhance collaboration and maintainability.
   ```python
   if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
   ```
Applying these clean code principles results in a more maintainable, readable, and organized codebase.These changes enhance the readability, structure, and maintainability of your code.
Changes made:
•	Moved the questions dictionary into the quiz_game function to encapsulate related data.
•	Passed the question and correct answer as parameters to the ask_question function for better function reusability.
•	Used f-strings for cleaner string formatting.
•	Improved variable names for clarity.
•	Combined the import statements for better readability.
These changes enhance the readability, structure, and maintainability of your code.

# **Unit Tests**
Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that individual components or functions perform as expected. In the provided code, a unittest framework is utilized to test the ask_question function within the TestQuizGame class. Unit tests help validate the correctness of specific functionalities, providing a safety net for code modifications. Additionally, the script demonstrates best practices by integrating version control with Git, initializing a repository, creating a .gitignore file, and performing an initial commit. The inclusion of a simple build process highlights the foundation for potential future enhancements. These practices contribute to a robust and maintainable codebase, fostering a reliable development workflow.
